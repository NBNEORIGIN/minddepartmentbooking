### 4. Storage Limitation

## Yearly Renewal System

### Why Yearly Renewal?
1. **Data Accuracy**: Ensures emergency contact info is current
2. **Consent Refresh**: Re-confirms consent annually
3. **GDPR Best Practice**: Regular review of data processing
4. **Safety**: Up-to-date emergency contacts

### How It Works
1. Forms automatically expire 1 year after completion
2. System blocks booking if form expired
3. Client redirected to renew form before next booking
4. Aly can manually trigger renewal for all or specific clients

### Manual Trigger Use Cases

- Policy changes requiring re-consent
- Emergency contact verification needed
- Annual compliance review
